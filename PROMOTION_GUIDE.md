## Sample Social Posts

### Twitter - Build Announcement
```
I just deployed my first smart contract on @base 🎉

Bloom 2026 - a year tracker where you check in weekly, on-chain.

Why on-chain?
→ Accountability you can't fake
→ Permanent record of showing up
→ Costs $0.01, zero profit to me

Try it: bloom26.vercel.app

#BuildOnBase
```

### Twitter - Personal Story
```
2025 taught me: consistency beats intensity.

So I built an app to help me (and others) show up every week in 2026.

52 weeks. 52 affirmations. 52 on-chain check-ins.

It's called Bloom 2026.

Not about perfection. Just about showing up 🌸
```

### Farcaster - /base channel
```
gm builders 👋

Just shipped Bloom 2026 - my first dApp on Base

It's a weekly check-in tracker with affirmations. Trying to make "showing up" a habit for 2026.

Would love feedback from the community.
